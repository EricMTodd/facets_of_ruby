# facets_of_ruby

The following will be the excercises and work done for the ExecOnline Replicants Program using Chris Pine's "Learn to Program - Second Edition" from "The Facets of Ruby Series".

Chapters 1 - 6 are contained in hello_world.rb.
Chapter 7 is contained in flow_control.rb
Chapter 8 is containted in arrays_and_iterators.rb
Chapter 9 is containted in writing_your_own_methods.rb
Chapter 10 is contained in fun_with_recursion.rb - Moving on to Chapter 11 as most of the examples herein are redundant, overly complicated without much real practice involved and also codewars challenges I have completed using Python in the past. (This was done with this understanding per John Costa's suggestion.)
Part of Chapter 11 is contained in save_load_write_read.rb - I skipped much of this chapter due to the fact that it was asking me to modify files on my computer, which I am not equipped to do, nor comfortable doing.
Chapter 12 is contained in new_classes_of_objects.rb - Some challenges skipped to save time, I can achieve these but would rather delve into more interesting topics such as classes and studying hashes further.

Chapter: 14 - Blocks and Procs
Section: 14.1 - Methods That Take Procs
Page: 116

### Notes while talking with Mr. John Costa

- Pure functions are functions are no matter when you do it if you pass the same argument it returns the same value.

- Monads wraps a value that "may exist". The box for schroedingers cat.
